                    Hi there! 
                    <br><br>
                    I graduated from George Mason University in May 2024 with a 
                    Bachelor's in Computer Science. During my time there, I helped
                    out as officer of a few different clubs, including the 
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://gadig.itch.io/">university's
                    game design club</a>. I also served as an Undergraduate
                    Teaching Assistant for different Computer Science courses.
                    <br><br>
                    During the summer of 2023, I worked as a Computer Science
                    Intern for AnaVation in Fairfax, VA. I primarily worked with
                    Android Studio and Java to build an Android app prototype within
                    a small team of other interns.
                    <br><br>
                    Right now, I'm looking for a new place to work and put my CS
                    degree to good use. I'm an aspiring Software Engineer (perhaps
                    a Game Developer if I could be so lucky), but I'm open to
                    any position where my previous experience and projects makes
                    me a good fit.
