  <h1>Avalon</h1>
  <div id="box">
    <p>This myserious island is never given much description in the few legends of Arthur it's referenced in, which leaves a lot of room for artistic interpretation!</p>
    <p>What we do know, thanks to the <i>Historia Regum Britanniae</i>, is that Avalon is allegedly the place where Arthur's Sword, Excalibur, was forged. </p>
    <p>In some versions of the story, after Arthur almost dies in the Battle of <a href="camlann.html">Camlann</a>, he is taken to Avalon by boat to heal from his wounds, where he resides to this day.</p>
