<body>
  <h1>Camlann</h1>
  <div id="box">
    <p>Thought to be a dark, twisted land, this is where King Arthur's army and Mordred fought to the death, in the <i>Battle of Camlann</i>.</p>
    <p>When it comes down to Arthur and Mordred, Mordred manages to stab Arthur through the stomach with a spear. Incredibly, as Mordred clutches the spear, Arthur manages to wedge his body up the spear and go in for a fatal blow on Mordred! Gross, but metal.</p>
    <p>What happens next is at the will of the author. Sometimes Arthur dies, other times he's taken to <a href="avalon.html">Avalon</a> to heal. Usually, Mordred also dies here, but in some versions he survives only to be killed by Lancelot later.</p>
