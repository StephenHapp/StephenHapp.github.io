  <h1>The Lady's Lake</h1>
  <div id="box">
    <p>Although the lake itself is never given a name, the Lady of the Lake, who resides here, plays an important role in Arthur's adventures.</p>
    <p>When Arthur breaks his original sword, the <a href="sword-stone.html">Sword in the Stone</a>, it is the Lady of the Lake who hands him Excalibur. Or, depending on the story, she repairs the sword, which was always Excalibur.</p>
    <p>This Lady really seems to get around, as she not only appears to other characters in the Arthurnian legends, but also makes appearances in later works unrelated to King Arthur! I reckon she's a fan favorite.</p>
