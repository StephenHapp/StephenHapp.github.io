  <h1>Lady Macbeth</h1>
  <div id="box">
  <p>Lady Macbeth is the driving force behind Macbeth's actions during the play. It was <a href="macchar.html">Macbeth</a>'s idea, of course, to kill Duncan to become king, but when Macbeth faces doubt and guilt, Lady Macbeth pushes him to get on with the plan.</p>
    <p>Throughout most of the play, Lady Macbeth is portrayed as clever and quick-witted. She saves Macbeth from accidentally confessing their actions when Macbeth sees <a href="banquo.html">Banquo</a>'s ghost at the dinner party, for example. However, by the end of the play, Lady Macbeth has succumbed to her <i>own</i> guilt and has gone crazy.</p>
    <p>In Act 5, Lady Macbeth screams right before a servant tells Macbeth that she has died. It's implied that it was a suicide, but her death isn't shown onstage, so <i>how</i> exactly she died is up to interpretation. What is known, however, is that Macbeth had become so egocentric that he doesn't really care when told that his wife just died.</p>
