  <h1>The Witches</h1>
  <div id="box">
    <p>The witches are the very first characters to appear in the play! With Hecate as their leader and a fondness for pranking, you can be certain that these three are always up to no good.</p>
    <p>When <a href="macchar.html">Macbeth</a> asks the witches if he will become King, the witches do not give him a straight answer. Instead, they show him three apparitions: a severed head, a bloody child, and a royal child holding a tree.</p>
    <p>Each apparition tells Macbeth a prophecy that will come true later in the play. After hearing the prophecies, Macbeth becomes convinced that he is invincible; that he is destined to become king. This pride is what leads to Macbeth's death at the end, after it's revealed that the prophecies were all misleading tricks.</p>
