				<h2>Recreating an older game for a newer engine</h2>
				<p>
					View the page on Roblox here: <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/7080833071/" target="_blank"><u>https://www.roblox.com/games/7080833071/</u></a>
					<br><br>
					This game was the first of three Roblox games I made during
					summer 2021. It's based on a much older Roblox game I used to
					play a lot when I was younger. Unfortunately, as the original game
					was made in 2010 and not frequently updated, much of the game is
					is currently broken. Wanting to play the game again as it originally
					was, I recreated it myself to work with the newer Roblox updates.
					<br><br>
					It was a lot of work studying the old game to get all the colors
					and measurements as close as possible to the original. Some updates
					have made some of the original aspects impossible to perfectly reproduce,
					but I used a few tricks to get the tools and some parts to work like
					old Roblox.
					<br><br>
					The tools aren't entirely programmed by me. I used some old
					tools freely available as models in Roblox Studio as a starting
					point and did my best to get them to work with modern Roblox.
					I learned a lot about Lua and Roblox Studio during this project,
					and the game is now apparently my most popular project yet with
					over 1.5K visits.
