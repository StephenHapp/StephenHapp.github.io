				<h2>Roblox username web scraper with multithreading</h2>
				<p>
					What this Python program does is gather as many usernames of
					Roblox profiles as it can and store them in a text document.
					Multithreading allows it to send lots of requests for different
					profiles at once, and also store the usernames in proper numerical
					order.
					<br><br>
					This project I remember working on in my dorm room during my
					freshman year at GMU. I'll admit I also felt a bit like
					Mark Zuckerberg as portrayed in <i>The Social Network</i>, which
					I had recently watched for a computer science course.
					Scraping the Roblox website for data to store for my own
					purposes... if I could think of a real use for it, that is.
					<br><br>
					This program worked a lot better when I first made it. When
					I went back to it to record the video, I found that Roblox had
					changed the layout of their profile pages. Also my program
					was receiving new errors from the Roblox website, so I had to work
					around those to get the program working again.
					<br><br>
					On and older version of my site I had posted a download link
					for the first 1,000,000 roblox usernames in a text document,
					but since it seems to crash Notepad now, I've decided it's best not
					to share it anymore.
